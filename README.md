# tesla-job-scraper
HINT: Tesla change their site frequently which breaks things. Also chrome had a change recently which broke something. I won't fix this anymore as I have lost interest.

scrapes job listings from Tesla website (link needs to be set)  
using Python3 with  
BeautifulSoup,  
Selenium and  
Pandas,  
and saves results to csv file.

Just run scrape.py in the same folder with the Chrome webdriver, if you use Chrome. Else get the driver for your browser.
The path to your browser's location might need to be adjusted.
